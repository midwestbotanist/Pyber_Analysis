# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
Ridesharing has continue to grow in popularity, with more usage in urban and suburban areas[1]. The increase in popularity can be attributed to a number of benefits such programs provide, benfits such as: saving money (cheaper on gas, parking, maintenance fees), time (ability to use HOV lanes, no need to spend time searching for parking, fewer vehicles on road resulting in less congestion), and even environmental reasons (fewer vehicles on the road result in lower emissions, also improved by consumers seeking out more fuel-efficient models, and better air quality - also due to fewer vehicles on the road)[2].

Uber and Lyft are the two most well-known ridesharing companies in the United States. However, despite their popularity, there is plenty of niches for other up and coming rideshare companies to fill. PyBer is one of these companies, with a chosen niche in providing affordable rideshare access in underserved neighborhoods. Underserved neighborhoods tend to lack access to quality healthcare, grocery stores, and quality schools. The presence of an affordable rideshare service can be the difference between the constituents being able to attend necessary healthcare specialist appointments (e.g. OBGYN, oncology, etc...) or bring home fresh fruits and vegetables in favor of often more convenient/closer fast food/gas station options.

The purpose of this analysis was to use the collected data (from 2019, pre-pandemic years) spanning 4 months to compare fares received between rural, urban, and suburban rides. In this analysis, the data will be placed into a summary data from which a multi-line graph will be produced. Matplotlib and Pandas have been selected to conduct the work.

## Results:

As can be seen in the graph, the summary of fares between January-April is distinctly different between urban, suburban, and rural areas. At best, the rural areas brought in ~$500 at the beginning of April, where the lowest performing amount in the urban areas was ~1600 during the start of January. The suburban data shows the fare summaries falls roughly halfway between rural and urban fares.


## Summary:
In general, the urban market provides the best profit for the rideshare services. Considering PyBer focuses on providing affordable rideshare access to underserved communities, PyBer needs to use this data to decide what future steps can be taken to stand by this mission whilst making a profit to keep the practices sustainable. Based upon the results, focus on the urban market makes the most sense from a profit-driven standpoint - and there are many underserved communities within urban areas that allow PyBer to fulfill its mission at the same time. However, many rural areas also host underserved communities that would benefit greatly from access to rideshare services. PyBer needs to decide as a company culture to what extent the profit needs to dictate the decisions for expansion and growth. 

### Recommendations:
1) Considering the urban data shows a significantly higher profit, the suggestion is to focus mostly on growing the urban market so that the increase in profit can then be used to begin expansion in the suburban and rural areas

2) Conduct another study to pinpoint best locations for growing rideshare access for all 3 city types (rural areas may be the best candidate here), with particular consideration for working out programs in conjunction to local healthcare/grocery facilities - perhaps even pickup points for local industry workers, to ensure loyal customers/continued use of the services

3) Consider a study to look at developing a baseline service available year-round with increased seasonal services during periods of high-demand 

4) PyBer could consider offering a subscription-based platform at different tiers in which unlimited trips can be taken within specified distances, with any trips exceeding the tier allowance coming with additional (but affordable) fees - surveying potential areas for resident interest would be a necessary step
